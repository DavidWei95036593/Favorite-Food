<div class="description">
<p>Fried chicken (also referred to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.</p>

<div class="description">
	<p>A chocolate biscuit is a biscuit which is covered in chocolate, or which has been made by replacing some of the flour with cocoa powder.

Chocolate biscuits are quite popular in places all over the world. The composition and recipe may vary considerably and there is often legislation to specify how the biscuit may be described. In the UK, a biscuit made without an external coating may only be described as "chocolate" if it contains at least 3% of dry cocoa solids.If there is a coating, this must contain cocoa butter as the fat to be described as chocolate, rather than just "chocolate-flavoured".</p>
